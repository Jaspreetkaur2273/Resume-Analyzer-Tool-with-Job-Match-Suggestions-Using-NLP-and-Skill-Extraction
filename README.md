In today’s highly competitive world, job recruitment has become one of the most critical yet time-
consuming processes for organizations. Every company receives hundreds or even thousands of resumes
for a single job opening, making it increasingly difficult for recruiters to manually review, analyze, and
shortlist candidates efficiently. Traditional hiring methods involve human resource (HR) professionals
manually screening resumes, which is often prone to human error, unconscious bias, and inconsistency.
Moreover, candidates may use different formats, styles, and structures in their resumes, making it
challenging for recruiters to identify relevant information accurately.
With the growing influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in
automating text-based tasks, there is a pressing need to implement intelligent systems that can
automatically analyze resumes, extract important skills and qualifications, and evaluate how closely they
match a particular job profile. This has given rise to the concept of AI-powered Resume Analyzers,
which are designed to simplify and enhance the recruitment process by providing automated, data-driven
analysis.
This project, titled “AI Resume Analyzer with Job Match Suggestions using NLP and Skill
Extraction”, aims to address these challenges by building a system capable of analyzing PDF-based
resumes, extracting key skills and certifications, and comparing them with a predefined set of job
requirements. The system then calculates a match percentage, which indicates how suitable a candidate
is for the selected job role. Additionally, it highlights the candidate’s strengths (matched skills) and
weaknesses (missing skills), thereby helping both recruiters and candidates in making better hiring and
preparation decisions.
The project uses a Flask-based web interface for user interaction, allowing users to select from multiple
job roles, upload resumes, and instantly view the analysis results. It leverages Python, NLP techniques,
and TF-IDF-based text comparison to perform accurate matching and provide transparent, interpretable
results.
